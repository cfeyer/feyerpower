* Figure out pin I/O modes (driven output, pull-up/pull-down, high impedance)

* Watchdog timer
* Battery class ADC - determine threshold and write code
* Figure out behavior of Tippmann's turbo mode
* BUG: Response trigger w/ 3-shot safety takes too long to time out
* Startup lights - flash orange


DONE * Configuration menus
DONE * Configuration menu write to EEPROM
DONE * class Menu - use array of records for menu structure/behavior/values
DONE * Lights in Menu always show that first parameter is selected
DONE * Write Configuration Main
DONE * Revert to factory settings
DONE * Detect shooting vs configuration modes
DONE * Wrap immediate enhanced mode option into three shot safety class
DONE * Create mux controller object
DONE * Stop inheriting from Periodic_Update_Interface to reduce data memory usage
DONE * Shooting Main - load settings from EEPROM to correct classes
DONE * BUG: Full-auto mode enables prematurely with three-shot safety (probably applies to turbo as well);
   begins shooting on hold-down of second pull
DONE * Shooting Lights - flash orange upon trigger pull (2ms green, 1ms red, repeat) - decided to flash on solenoid instead of trigger
